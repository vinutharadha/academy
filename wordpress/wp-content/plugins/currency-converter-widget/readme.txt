WordPress powers over a quarter of the Web and its powerful range of plugins is part of the reason why.  

With international business booming, global tourism ever popular and increasing immigration part of our daily lives, a good [Currency Converter](https://www.currency.wiki) can help your site gain the edge over your competitors no matter what field you are in.

The Exchange Rate Widget plugin powered by Currency Wiki may be exactly the simple but versatile option for the job.

Reach the world with its eight different language options - English, Dutch, French, Hindi, Italian, Russian, Spanish and Ukrainian - all interchangeable with a single click.

This WordPress Currency Converter is built around ease and functionality. You can set commonly-used currency pairs such as USD/EUR and every conversion is made 'on the fly' as you type - you do not even have to hit 'Enter'.

Instantly customize its visual elements from text to background to font color so it fits seamlessly into your existing theme. If you update your website's look, the handy preview feature lets you adapt the widget with a few clicks.

The design from Currency.Wiki even gives you full control. You can even skip the Exchange Rate Widget sidebar altogether - it will generate shortcode so the widget only appears on specific pages or posts.

Discover how a simple, free WordPress Exchange Rate widget can help create a great user experience and even drive traffic to your page. 

Disclaimer: Our widget has a link to Currency.Wiki (source of exchange rates) if you don't support that, please do not install this widget or check "Widget Demo" above before installation.
